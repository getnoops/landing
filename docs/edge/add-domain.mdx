# Add a domain

:::info
This is a completely optional step, you can use the _ugly domain_ provided by No_Ops that is generated from an environment.
:::

Once you have [created an environment](../getting-started/create-environment.mdx), you can add a domain.

1. On the top left of the No_Ops portal, click on the arrow next to your organisation's name, and select `Settings`.

2. Click `Domains` on the sidebar and then `Add domain`.

   <Image src="/docs/domain/add_domain.webp" />

3. Specify your domain name, select the environment you want to assign this domain to and click `Add`.

4. Once your domain has been created, you need to verify the nameservers with your domain provider.

5. Copy each nameserver into your DNS management console and click `Verify`.

6. Once AWS verifies your domain, No_Ops will display the domain as `Verified`.

:::note[Next step]
You are now ready to [create an edge](./add-edge.mdx)!
