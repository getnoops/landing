# Introduction

## Welcome to No_Ops!

No_Ops is the modern infrastructure platform for software engineers.

Rather than being slowed down by DevOps and worried about security and performance, No_Ops allows you to focus on your product.

---

## Getting started

Before getting into any setup, we'd like to go over some No_Ops specific concepts:

### Configs

:::tip[Configs]
Configs are the main building block in No_Ops, you will spend most of your time creating and managing configs.
:::

There are three types of configs:

1. Compute

   - EC2 instances

2. Storage

   - RDS database clusters

3. Integration

   - SNS topics
   - SQS queues

### Resources

:::tip[Resources]
Resources are the actual infrastructure behind your configs. **Each config has at least once resource.**
:::

```mermaid
flowchart LR
config["Config"]

resource["Resource"]


config --> resource
```

<br />

A config by itself is just a placeholder, it doesn't do anything until a resource is added to it.

See each config mapped to its possible resources below:

<br />

```mermaid
flowchart LR
compute["Compute"]

container["Container"]
bucket["Bucket"]
database["Database"]
queue["Queue"]

compute --> container
compute --> bucket
compute --> database
compute --> queue
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

```mermaid
flowchart LR
storage["Storage"]

cluster["Cluster"]


storage --> cluster
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

```mermaid
flowchart LR
queue["Queue"]
queue --> queue

notification["Notification"]
notification --> notification
```

### FAQ

<details>
	<summary>
		What is the difference between an `Integration Config Queue` and a `Compute Resource Queue`?
	</summary>

    <div>
    You may have noticed that there is an integration config type named queue and a compute resource type named queue.

<ol>
	<li>
		`If you want a globally accessible queue for multiple computes, use the
		integration config queue`.
	</li>

    <li>
    `If you want a queue that is only accessible by a single compute, use the compute resource queue`.
    </li>

</ol>
   </div>
