# Introduction

## Welcome to No_Ops!

No_Ops is the modern infrastructure platform for software engineers.

Rather than being slowed down by DevOps and worried about security and performance, No_Ops allows you to focus on your product.

## Getting started

Before getting into any setup, we'd like to go over some No_Ops specific concepts:

:::tip[Configs]
Configs are the main building block in No_Ops, you will spend most of your time creating and managing configs.
:::

There are three types of configs:

- Compute _(EC2 instances)_

- Storage _(RDS database clusters)_

- Integration _(SNS topics and SQS queues)_

:::note[Next step]
Start by [creating your own organisation](./getting-started/setup-organisation/create-organisation.mdx).
