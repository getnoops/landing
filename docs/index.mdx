# Introduction

## Welcome to No_Ops!

No_Ops is the modern infrastructure platform for software engineers.

Rather than being slowed down by DevOps and worried about security and performance, No_Ops allows you to focus on your product.

---

## Getting started

Before getting into any setup, we'd like to go over some No_Ops specific concepts:

### Configs

:::tip[Configs]
Configs are the main building block in No_Ops, you will spend most of your time creating and managing configs.
:::

There are three types of configs:

- Compute _(EC2 instances)_

- Storage _(RDS database clusters)_

- Integration _(SNS topics and SQS queues)_

### Resources

:::tip[Resources]
Resources are the actual infrastructure behind your configs. Each config has at least once resource.
:::

- Compute:

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
  compute["Compute"]

  container["Container"]
  bucket["Bucket"]
  database["Database"]
  queue["Queue"]

  compute --> container
  compute --> bucket
  compute --> database
  compute --> queue
  ```

- Storage:

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
  storage["Storage"]

  cluster["Cluster"]


  storage --> cluster
  ```

- Integration:

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
  queue["Queue"]

  notification["Notification"]
  ```

### FAQ

<details>
	<summary>
		What is the difference between an integration `Queue` and a resource `Queue`?
	</summary>

    <div>
    You may have noticed that there is an integration config type called `Queue` and a compute resource type called `Queue`.

<ol>
	<li>
		If you want a globally accessible queue for multiple computes, use the
		`integration` config type `Queue`.
	</li>

    <li>
    If you want a queue that is only accessible by a single compute, use the `resource`
    type `Queue`.
    </li>

</ol>

This rule applies to the `Notification` config and resource types as well.
