# Create your first compute

Once you have an [environment](./create-environment.mdx), you can create & deploy your first compute.

1. In the top left of the No_Ops portal, click `Compute`, then select `Create compute` on the right.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/create_compute.webp" />

2. Give your compute a name and code, along with an optional folder to place it in. Then click `Create`.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/create_compute_form.webp" />

---

### Add a container repository

Each compute requires a separate container repository (ECR) which will store your container images.

3. On the compute's dashboard, click `Repositories` in the top navbar or `Create a container repository`.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/no_container_repositories.webp" />

4. Click `Create repository`.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/create_repository.webp" />

5. Enter a code for your container repository and click `Create`.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/create_repository_dialog.webp" />

6. You can now view information about your repository.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/view_repository.webp" />

### Configure a container resource

7. Go back to the compute dashboard in the top navbar and click the `Add a resource for [compute-code]` button.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/add_compute_resource.webp" />

8. Add the image URI of your container (will be pushed to ECR in the [Add the CLI to your pipeline](./cli/ci-cd-cli) step) and configure options such as CPU & memory.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/container_info.webp" />

9. If you want your compute to be publicly accessible, click the `Edges` tab.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/compute_edges.webp" />

### Allow communication to / from your compute

10. Configs are zero trust by default. If you have services that communicate between each other, you'll have to explicitly specify them.

    <Image src="/docs/compute/allow_access.webp" />

---

11. You're ready to go! Click `Save` in the bottom right.

    <Image src="/docs/compute/save_compute.webp" />
