import { Image } from "@site/src/components/Image";

# Create your first compute

1. In the top left of the No_Ops portal, click `Compute`, then select `Create compute` on the right.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/create_compute.webp" />

2. Give your compute a name and code, along with an optional folder to place it in. Then click `Create`.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/create_compute_form.webp" />

---

### Create your first revision

Specify your container resource options and add any extra resources such as a bucket, database or queue.

:::note[What is a revision?]
A revision is a version of your compute. You can have multiple revisions of a compute, each with different configurations.
:::

3. Click `Create revision`.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/create_revision.webp" />

4. Add the image tag of your container (will be pushed to ECR in the [Add the CLI to your pipeline](../deploying/ci-cd-cli) step) and configure options such as CPU & memory.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/container_info.webp" />

5. Configs are zero trust by default. If you have services that communicate between each other, you'll have to explicitly specify them.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/allow_access.webp" />

---

6. You're ready to go! Click `Save` in the bottom right.

   <Image src="/docs/compute/save_compute.webp" />

---

### Container repositories

:::note
Each compute requires a separate container repository (ECR) which will store your container images.
:::

Each time a compute is created, you'll notice that a container repository is also created by default:

<Image src="/docs/compute/repository_notification.webp" />

<Image src="/docs/compute/view_repository.webp" />

---

:::info[info]
If you want to connect your compute to the outside world, check out [adding an edge](../guide/internet-access).
:::

:::note[Next step]
You can now learn about [adding the No_Ops CLI to your pipeline](../deploying/ci-cd-cli).
