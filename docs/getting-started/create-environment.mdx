# Create an environment

Once you have [connected your AWS account](./connect-aws-account.mdx), you can create an environment.

1. On the top left of the No_Ops portal, click on the arrow next to your organisation's name, and select `Settings`.

2. Click `Environments` on the sidebar and then `Add environment`.

3. Give your environment a name and code, select the AWS account you want to use, assign up to 5 availbility zones and any amount of regions.

4. Once your environment has been created you can view any outputs and resources generated by the CloudFormation stack.

5. No_Ops also automatically generates an _ugly domain_ which you can use if you don't have your own domain setup.

:::note[Next step]
You can now [add your own domain](./add-domain.mdx)!
