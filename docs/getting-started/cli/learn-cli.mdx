# Learn about the No_Ops CLI

:::info
This page is mainly for power users, if you just want to deploy an application, see [Add the CLI to your pipeline](./ci-cd-cli).
:::

The main use of the CLI is to:

- Allow power users to interact with the No_Ops platform from the command line
- Automate deployments to an environment using GitHub Actions (see [Add the CLI to your pipeline](./ci-cd-cli))

## Installation

You can install the CLI directly from our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/getnoops/ops/releases) page.

## Usage

:::tip
You can get a full list of commands by running `ops --help`
:::

We'll go over some basic commands to get you started.

### Login

Authenticates the CLI with your No_Ops account

```bash
ops login
```

### Select an organisation

Sets the current organisation for the CLI

```bash
ops orgs list
```

```bash
ops settings set orgs [org-code]
```

### Container repository (ECR)

```bash
ops container-repository list [compute-code]
```

```bash
ops container-repository create [compute-code] [new-ecr-repo-code]
```

```bash
ops container-repository delete [compute-code] [ecr-repo-code]
```

### API keys

:::danger
If you lose your API key it's gone forever. You'll need to create a new one and update your GitHub secrets.
:::

```bash
ops keys create
```

If you've lost your key and need to generate a new one, you can use the following command:

```bash
ops keys update [key-id]
```

### Deployments

```bash
ops deploy apply [env-code] [config-code] [version-number] [flags]
```

:::note[Next step]
We'll go over [adding the CLI to your pipeline](./ci-cd-cli.mdx) which will automate your deployments to an environment.
