# Add an edge

Once you have [a domain](./add-domain.mdx), you can add an edge.

- You can use the 'ugly domain' that is generated from when you [create an environment](./create-environment.mdx).

Edges allow your computes to be publicly accessible. You can assign an edge to a compute, which we'll get into later.

:::info
If you don't want a compute to be publicly accessible, you can skip assigning an edge to it.

1. On the top left of the No_Ops portal, click on the arrow next to your organisation's name, and select `Settings`.

2. Click `Edges` on the sidebar and then `Add edge`.

   <Image src="/docs/edge/add_edge.webp" />

3. Select the domain you want to assign this edge to, along with an optional subdomain.

4. Once your edge has been created you can view the resources generated by the CloudFormation stack.

:::note[Next step]
You can now [create your first compute](./create-first-compute.mdx)!
