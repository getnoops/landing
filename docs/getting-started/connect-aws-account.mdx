# Connect your AWS account

Once you have [created an organisation](./setup-organisation/create-organisation.mdx), you can connect your AWS account to it.

## Log in to your AWS account

- No_Ops creates a `CloudFormation` stack by redirecting to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home), make sure you are logged in to the right AWS account.
