# Concepts

Before getting into any setup, we'd like to go over some No_Ops specific concepts:

## Configs

:::tip[Configs]
Configs are the main building block in No_Ops, you will spend most of your time creating and managing configs.
:::

There are three types of configs:

1. Compute

   - EC2 instances

2. Storage

   - RDS database clusters

3. Integration

   - SNS topics
   - SQS queues

## Resources

:::tip[Resources]
Resources are the actual infrastructure behind your configs. **Each config has at least once resource.**
:::

```mermaid
flowchart LR
config["Config"]

resource["Resource"]


config --> resource
```

<br />

A config by itself is just a placeholder, it doesn't do anything until a resource is added to it.

See each config mapped to its possible resources below:

<br />

```mermaid
flowchart LR
compute["Compute"]

container["Container"]
bucket["Bucket"]
database["Database"]
queue["Queue"]

compute --> container
compute --> bucket
compute --> database
compute --> queue
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

```mermaid
flowchart LR
storage["Storage"]
cluster["Cluster"]

storage --> cluster
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

```mermaid
flowchart LR
notification["Notification"]
notification --> notification
```

<br />
<br />
<br />
