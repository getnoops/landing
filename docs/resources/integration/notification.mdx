# Notification

Notifications represent SNS (Simple Notification Service) in AWS.

All [Queues](../compute/queue) require a parent notification to be assigned to them.

```yaml
code: notification-events
class: notification
name: Notification Events

resources:
  - code: notification-events
    type: notification
    data:
      is_fifo: true
```
