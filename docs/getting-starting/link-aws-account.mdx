Once you have [created a new organisation](./setup-organisation.mdx), you can link your AWS account to it.

## 1. Log in to your AWS account

- In the AWS console, simply log in to your AWS account.

## 2. Link your AWS account with No_Ops

- On the top left of the No_Ops portal, click on the arrow next to your organisation's name, and select `Settings`.
