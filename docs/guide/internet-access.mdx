# Internet access

A compute is not publicly accessible by default.

Edges allow your computes to be publicly accessible by routing traffic to a specific path.

---

Once you have [a domain](./custom-domains), you can add an edge.

- You can use the _ugly domain_ that is generated from when you [create an environment](../getting-started/create-environment).

1. On the top left of the No_Ops portal, click on the arrow next to your organisation's name, and select `Settings`.

2. Click `Edges` on the sidebar and then `Add edge`.

   <Image src="/docs/edge/add_edge.webp" />

3. Select the domain you want to assign this edge to, along with an optional subdomain.

4. Once your edge has been created you can view the resources generated by the CloudFormation stack.

# Assigning an edge to a compute

1. Create a new compute revision by selecting the `New revision` button on the right.

   <Image src="/docs/edge/compute_new_revision.webp" />

2. Click on the `Resources` tab on the left, then select `Edges`.

You can add multiple paths to an edge, each with their own priority.

- The example below directs all paths on the selected domains to this compute.
- The priority is set to `1000` in case other computes want to prioritise a specific path and override this catch all rule.
